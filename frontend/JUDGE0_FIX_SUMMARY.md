# üîß Judge0 RapidAPI Integration - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Your dev server was still using the **cached environment variables** pointing to `http://localhost:2358` instead of the RapidAPI endpoint.

## Root Cause
Vite only loads `.env` files **when the dev server starts**. Changes to `.env` while the server is running are **completely ignored** until you restart.

## Solution

### Step 1: Verify .env File ‚úÖ
Your `.env` file is already correct:
```properties
VITE_JUDGE0_URL=https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
VITE_JUDGE0_API_KEY=f0d95e5377msh116a0db8b5d47d6p1874b4jsn347ce9c48047
```

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server (REQUIRED)

**Option A: Use the PowerShell Script (Easiest)**
```powershell
cd c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\codementorai2\frontend
.\restart-dev.ps1
```

**Option B: Manual Restart**
```powershell
# 1. Kill existing processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# 2. Navigate to frontend
cd c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\codementorai2\frontend

# 3. Clear Vite cache (optional but recommended)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.vite

# 4. Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify It's Working

After the server starts, open your browser console (F12) and look for:

```
üîß Judge0 Configuration: {
  url: "https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com",
  hasApiKey: true,
  apiKeyPrefix: "f0d95e5377..."
}
```

When you click **Run**, you should see:
```
üì§ Submitting to Judge0: {
  url: "https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com",
  language: "python",
  language_id: 71,
  ...
}
```

### Step 4: Test on Problem Page

1. Go to a problem page (e.g., `/problem/add-two-numbers`)
2. Write some code
3. Click **Run** button
4. Check Network tab in browser DevTools
5. You should see request to: `https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com/submissions`

## What Was Changed

### 1. Added Debug Logging
- `judge0Service.ts` now logs configuration on load
- Submission requests log the URL being used
- Response data is logged for debugging

### 2. Better Error Messages
- 401 errors show "authentication failed"
- 429 errors show "rate limit exceeded"
- Network errors show detailed information

### 3. Created Helper Scripts
- `restart-dev.ps1` - Automated restart script
- `RESTART_DEV_SERVER.md` - Documentation
- `EnvDebug.tsx` - Debug page to check env vars

## Test Cases

Test cases are **NOT mocked**. They come from your backend API:
- Public test cases: `GET /test-cases/public?problem_id={id}`
- Hidden test cases: `GET /test-cases/hidden?problem_id={id}`

If you don't see test cases:
1. Check that your backend is running (`uvicorn main:app --reload`)
2. Verify you have test cases in MongoDB for that problem
3. Check browser console for API errors

## Judge0 Payload Format

When you click **Run**, the following payload is sent:

```json
{
  "source_code": "def solution():\n    pass",
  "language_id": 71,
  "stdin": "test input here",
  "expected_output": "expected output here",
  "cpu_time_limit": 2,
  "memory_limit": 128000
}
```

Headers included:
```
Content-Type: application/json
X-RapidAPI-Key: f0d95e5377msh116a0db8b5d47d6p1874b4jsn347ce9c48047
X-RapidAPI-Host: judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Still hitting localhost:2358 | **Restart dev server** (see Step 2) |
| 401 Unauthorized | Check API key in `.env` |
| 429 Rate Limit | Wait (50 requests/day limit on free tier) |
| No test cases showing | Check backend is running and has test cases in DB |
| CORS errors | Not applicable (server-to-server with RapidAPI) |

## Next Steps

1. **RESTART YOUR DEV SERVER NOW** using the restart script
2. Open browser and check console logs
3. Navigate to a problem page
4. Click Run and verify it hits RapidAPI
5. Check Network tab to confirm URL is correct

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Dev server restarted
- [ ] Console shows Judge0 config with RapidAPI URL
- [ ] Run button triggers submission
- [ ] Network tab shows request to judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
- [ ] Test results appear in UI
- [ ] No 401/429 errors in console

**‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER:** Every time you change `.env`, you MUST restart the dev server!
